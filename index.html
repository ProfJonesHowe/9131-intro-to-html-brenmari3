	<h1>Why I love working in EMS</h1>
	<h2>Five Quad Volunteer Ambulance Service</h2>
	<h3>How I Got Involved</h3>
<p> Something that I have become passionate about in the past year is EMS! I never in a million years would have thought that I could find myself in the position I am in now, but through the volunteer ambulance service on campus I was able to find not only a love for healthcare but also an incredible community of people who love to help others. Last year, second semester of my freshman year, I applied and was accepted to become a member in training for the ambulance service. This means rigorous training for the entire semester until we ultimately passed the practical skills exam. Then over the summer I was able to take the New York State EMT (Emergency Medical Technician) course, and passed the written state exam only 3 months later. Now I'm able to ride and have shifts at the station each week! Nothing is more rewarding that being able to be the calm for somebody else and, hopefully, make them smile in what can potentially be the worst day of their life. While this may not be my future careeer, there will always be a soft spot and deep appreciation in my heart for EMS.</p>
